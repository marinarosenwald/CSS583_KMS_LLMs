Reiterate the key points to me from this piece of text like I know nothing: The industrial age, when we made things, has made way for the knowledge age, when
organizational success depends on what it collectively knows, how efficiently it uses
what it knows, and how quickly it acquires and uses new knowledge (Davenport & Prusak,
1998). The most valuable benefits from KM arise from sharing knowledge with current
fellow employees and with future (often unknown) employees. Sharing knowledge
with current fellow employees ensures it moves around the organization so everyone
can benefit from best practices (adopt newer, better ways of doing things) and lessons
learned (avoid repeating things that failed).
KM, through knowledge use and reuse, has two major goals: improving organiza-
tional efficiency and increasing the organizational capacity to innovate.

I am a human and I am here to summarize. I am an intelligent human, but I am
limited to what I can comprehend. If I am to summarize this book I would summarize
it as:
* The industrial revolution, and the age of mass production, has made way for the
information age, and knowledge is our main asset and competitive advantage.
* The information age is characterized by the knowledge of our organization, and how
we can make the best use of it to achieve business success.
* Knowledge management is the process of capturing and storing knowledge in
organization. It enables the organization to share it with all the employees, and
use the collective knowledge to improve organizational efficiency and capacity for
innovation.

This book was a very interesting read and the authors did a very good job of giving a
general overview of the concept of Knowledge Management and how it is used in
organizational settings. This book was a good read for someone who is new to the
concept of Knowledge Management because of the authors use of analogies and easy to
follow writing style. They did a good job of giving an overview of some of the key ideas
related to Knowledge Management.

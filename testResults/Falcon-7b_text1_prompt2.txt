summarize this text like I am a 5th grader: The industrial age, when we made things, has made way for the knowledge age, when
organizational success depends on what it collectively knows, how efficiently it uses
what it knows, and how quickly it acquires and uses new knowledge (Davenport & Prusak,
1998). The most valuable benefits from KM arise from sharing knowledge with current
fellow employees and with future (often unknown) employees. Sharing knowledge
with current fellow employees ensures it moves around the organization so everyone
can benefit from best practices (adopt newer, better ways of doing things) and lessons
learned (avoid repeating things that failed).
KM, through knowledge use and reuse, has two major goals: improving organiza-
tional efficiency and increasing the organizational capacity to innovate.

Prusak (Davenport, & Prusak, 1998). The Industrial Age was the time when people
worked together, with tools, machines, and factories to make things (p. 1).

The Industrial Age ended in the late 20th century with the rise of new
technologies and the Information Age, which is a knowledge age. (p. 1-2)

The new technologies that emerged with the rise of information technology and the
Internet, have led to a new way of doing things. People no longer work together
in person, but instead work together remotely. Knowledge is no longer stored in a
single location but in distributed, shared spaces (p. 2).

In this new knowledge age, there are two major goals: improving organizational ef-
ficiency and increasing the capacity to innovate. In order to accomplish these,
employees need to know how to effectively use the tools and resources availa-
ble in the organization, such as people, knowledge base, and the organizational
structure (p. 2).

The Industrial Age was the time when we made things, but knowledge

Summarize this text in 100 words: The industrial age, when we made things, has made way for the knowledge age, when
organizational success depends on what it collectively knows, how efficiently it uses
what it knows, and how quickly it acquires and uses new knowledge (Davenport & Prusak,
1998). The most valuable benefits from KM arise from sharing knowledge with current
fellow employees and with future (often unknown) employees. Sharing knowledge
with current fellow employees ensures it moves around the organization so everyone

learned (avoid repeating things that failed).
KM, through knowledge use and reuse, has two major goals: improving organiza-
tional efficiency and increasing the organizational capacity to innovate.

that organizations have to manage knowledge to achieve better efficiency.
Knowledge is a resource for any organization; therefore, it is important to manage it.
As a result of this, the basic idea of KM is “to make it possible for the organization to
share knowledge more effectively within the organization so that they could make better
decisions”. KM is also used to manage a company’s information resources. The
purpose is to improve the knowledge-based decisions. KM is used to manage the
information of the organization, which means that the management of knowledge is
also an important part of KM (“Management of Knowledge - Definition, Importance,
and Types”, n.d.).
KM also involves the use of various technologies in the collection, analysis, and
sharing of organizational knowledge. This includes the use of computers, networks
and intranet, and other technological applications. The purpose of

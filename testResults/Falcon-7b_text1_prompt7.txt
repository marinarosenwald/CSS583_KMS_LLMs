Summarize this text in 50 words like I know nothing: The industrial age, when we made things, has made way for the knowledge age, when
organizational success depends on what it collectively knows, how efficiently it uses
what it knows, and how quickly it acquires and uses new knowledge (Davenport & Prusak,
1998). The most valuable benefits from KM arise from sharing knowledge with current
fellow employees and with future (often unknown) employees. Sharing knowledge
with current fellow employees ensures it moves around the organization so everyone
can benefit from best practices (adopt newer, better ways of doing things) and lessons
learned (avoid repeating things that failed).
KM, through knowledge use and reuse, has two major goals: improving organiza-
tional efficiency and increasing the organizational capacity to innovate.

#### Response from Falcon-7b:
I know very little about this book and the author, but I have read the first few pages.  The book is about the industrial revolution and how
it has affected society, business practice and our economy.  The author talks about how the industrial revolution is a key turning point
in the history of the world.  It was the event that allowed for the rise of industry and the modern economy.

Reiterate the key points to me from this piece of text like I know nothing: A little knowledge that acts is worth infinitely more than much knowledge that is idle.

This chapter describes the major processes involved in KM: capturing, creating, codi-
fying, sharing, accessing, applying, and reusing knowledge within and between orga-
nizations. It presents major KM processes from Bukowitz and Williams (2000), Carlile
and Rebentisch (2003), Evans, Dalkir, and Bidian (2015), McElroy (2003), Meyer and
Zack (1996), Wiig (1993), and Xu et al. (2010). A comprehensive review of KM pro-
cess frameworks by Heisig (2009) is included. A synthesis of these approaches is then
developed as a framework for following the path information takes to become a valu-
able knowledge asset for a given organization. This chapter concludes with a discus-
sion of the strategic and practical implications of managing knowledge throughout
the KM life cycle. 
Learning Objectives
1. Describe how valuable individual, group, and organizational knowledge is cap-
tured, created, codified, shared, accessed, applied, and reused throughout the KM
cycle.
2. Compare and contrast major KM processes: Do some processes share a label with
another process? Are some distinct processes?
3. Define the major KM processes and provide concrete examples of how each addresses
efficiency goals through reuse. What are some examples of how they address trans-
formational goals through innovation?
4. Identify the major challenges and benefits of each KM process.
5. Describe the additional challenges posed by global or distributed KM processes.

Introduction
As with a generally accepted definition of KM, consensus is lacking for terms to describe
the major steps in the KM cycle. Table 2.1 summarizes the major terms found in the
KM literature. However, on closer inspection, the terms overlap in the steps involved
in a KM cycle. Heisig (2009) comprehensively compared 160 KM frameworks. He found
that diverse terms are used, although common underlying categories for KM processes
exist, such as share, create, use, store, identify, and acquire. The frameworks discussed
in this chapter meet the following criteria:
They have been implemented and validated in real-world settings.
They are comprehensive regarding steps found in the KM literature.
They include detailed descriptions of the KM processes involved in each of the steps.
KM cycle approaches from Meyer and Zack (1996), Bukowitz and Williams (2000),
McElroy (1999, 2003), Wiig (1993), Carlile and Rebentisch (2003), Evans, Dalkir, and
Bidian (2015), and Xu et al. (2010) are described in greater detail in this chapter. They
were selected as the most relevant, and each one builds on the previous models by
contributing one or more additional components. The chapter concludes with a sum-
mary and aggregation of all key components in the KM cycle 
Major Approaches to the KM Cycle
Meyer and Zack
The Meyer and Zack (1996) KM cycle is derived from work on the design and develop-
ment of information products. Information products are, broadly, any information
sold to internal or external customers such as databases, news synopses, and customer
profiles. This approach provides several useful analogies, such as the notion of a prod-
uct platform (the knowledge repository) and of an information process platform (the
knowledge refinery), to emphasize that value-added processes are required to leverage
the knowledge of an organization. The KM cycle consists primarily of creating a higher-
value-added knowledge product at each stage of knowledge processing. For example, a
basic database may represent an example of knowledge that has been created. Value can
then be added by extracting trends from this data. The original information has been
repackaged to now provide trend analyses useful for organizational decision making.
In Meyer and Zack's approach, the KM processes comprise the technologies, facili-
ties, and processes for manufacturing products and services. The content is unique for
each type of business or organization. For example, banks have content relating to
personal and commercial accounts, insurance companies hold information on poli-
cies and claims, and pharmaceutical companies have a large body of scientific and
marketing knowledge accumulated for products under design or currently sold. The
information unit is singled out as the formally defined atom of information to be
stored, retrieved, and manipulated. This notion of a unit of information is a critical
concept that should be applied to knowledge items as well. A focus at the level of a
knowledge object distinguishes KM from document management. Whereas a docu-
ment management system stores, manipulates, and retrieves documents as integral
wholes, KM can easily identify, extract, and manage several different knowledge items
(sometimes referred to as knowledge objects) within a document.
The knowledge repository often forms the first kernel of an organizational or corpo-
rate memory. A sample repository for a railway administration organization is shown
in figure 2.1. Figures 2.2 and 2.3 summarize the major stages in the Meyer and Zack
cycle.
Refinement is the major contribution of this cycle. This may be physical (e.g.,
migrating from one medium to another) or logical (restructuring, relabeling, indexing,
and integrating). Refining also refers to cleaning up (e.g., sanitizing content so as to
ensure complete anonymity of sources and key players involved) or standardizing (e.g.,
conforming to templates of a best practice or lesson learned as used within a particu-
lar organization). The repository and the refinery together enable the management of 
valuable knowledge of a firm. Although not explicitly described in the Meyer and Zack cycle, 
management includes having to continually renew the repository and the refinary to avoid obsolescence. 
Renewal should be added to the cycle diagram in the form of a feedback loop that involves rethinking 
the basic content and structure of the repository to decide whether different, newer products or 
repackaging is required. This may mean greater depth of an analysis, an updated report, greater 
integration, more sophisticated cross-linking, or greater standardization of content.

The topic of this chapter is knowledge management, a concept that can be further defined into two words: "knowledge management" and "intellectual assets." Knowledge management is about systematically managing knowledge within an organization so that it can be used to benefit the organization. The most valuable intellectual assets, according to Stewart, are those that employees take with them when they leave the office; lesser and prusak agree that this is true but have no clear strategy for managing this knowledge. This chapter will focus on how managers should manage these intellectual assets in order to make them easily accessible and future-ready.

The industrial age was when we made things, but now we're in the knowledge age where we focus on what our company knows and how well it uses that information. It's important for companies to share their knowledge with each other and with future employees so everyone can learn from the best ways of doing things and avoid making the same mistakes over again. The goal of sharing knowledge is to make the organization more efficient and innovative.

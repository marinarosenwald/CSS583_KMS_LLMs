Of course! Here is a summary of the text for 5th grade students:

Hey there, young learner! Do you know what "The Industrial Age" means? It's when people made things like factories and machines. But now we are in the "Knowledge Age," where it's important for organizations (like schools or companies) to use their knowledge to be successful. They need to share ideas with each other so everyone can learn from them and do better things. Sharing knowledge helps us make new discoveries and find better ways of doing things! It also helps us avoid making the same mistakes over and over again. So, knowledge is super important in this age because it makes organizations more efficient and helps them come up with new ideas to be successful!

The industrial age was when people made things. Now we are in the knowledge age where we focus on learning new things and sharing them with each other so everyone can be more efficient and creative! In this age, success depends on how well an organization uses what it knows and how fast it learns new things to make better products or services. Sharing knowledge between employees helps us all learn from their experiences and avoid making the same mistakes over and over again. By sharing what we know, we can also improve our work and make new discoveries! The key is to use this knowledge wisely so we can be more efficient and innovative in what we do.

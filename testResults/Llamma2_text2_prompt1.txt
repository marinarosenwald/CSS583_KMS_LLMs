Knowledge management (KM) is an organization's deliberate effort to maximize the value of its knowledge assets by capturing, storing, sharing, and applying them effectively across the organization. This involves promoting knowledge creation, sharing, and application through various means such as lessons learned, best practices, and corporate memory. The importance of KM lies in the recognition that an organization's greatest asset is often its employees' collective knowledge, which can walk out the door when employees leave the organization if not properly managed. To address this challenge, KM aims to identify and manage intellectual assets, produce legacy materials, and create an environment where knowledge flows easily across individuals, communities of practice, and the organization as a whole. By doing so, organizations can leverage their knowledge assets to innovate, improve operations, and make informed decisions that drive business success.

Knowledge management is crucial for organizations as it enables them to add value through reuse and innovation by coordinating their people, technology, processes, and organizational structure. Knowledge is an organization's greatest asset according to executives, but they often struggle with managing it due to lack of awareness or understanding of its importance. Identifying and preserving valuable knowledge before it walks out the door is essential for organizations to retain this asset. This can be done by creating legacy materials such as lessons learned, best practices, and corporate memory that are easily accessible and retrievable in the future. Knowledge management is an ongoing process of capturing, storing, sharing, and applying knowledge to foster continuous learning within an organization.

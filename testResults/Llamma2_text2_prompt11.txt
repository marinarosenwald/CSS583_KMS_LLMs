Knowledge Management is like a big library where all the important information from your workplace is stored so it can be easily found and used again later. It's also like having smart people who know how to find the right books on the shelves and share them with others when they need them. When employees come and go, their knowledge doesn't disappear because it's all written down in the library for everyone to use. This way, the organization can keep learning and growing even after people leave.

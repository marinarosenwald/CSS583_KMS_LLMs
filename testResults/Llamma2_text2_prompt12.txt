Knowledge management (KM) is like a team sport. It involves coordinating people, tech-
nology, processes, and organizational structure to create, share, and apply knowledge for the benefit of the organization. This means identifying valuable knowledge and protecting it from being lost when employees leave or retire. A good KM strategy also includes creating legacy materials that are easy to find and use in the future. The goal is to make it as simple as possible for individuals and teams to share what they know with each other, build on each other's ideas, and learn from their experiences. In essence, KM is all about maximizing the value of an organization's intellectual assets by creating a culture that encourages knowledge sharing and innovation.

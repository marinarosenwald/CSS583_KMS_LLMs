Knowledge management is like a big box full of important things that we need to know. It's like keeping all your favorite toys in one place so you can find them easily when you want to play with them. But it's not just about putting everything in the same box, it's about organizing it so it makes sense and is easy to understand. Then, we can share our favorite toys with others and learn new things together!

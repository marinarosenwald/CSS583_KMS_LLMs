Knowledge management (KM) is the deliberate and systematic coordination of an organization's resources to add value through knowledge creation, sharing, and innovation. It involves identifying valuable intellectual assets and ensuring their preservation for future use. This includes creating legacy materials, storing them in a way that makes retrieval and reuse easy, and promoting the sharing of knowledge between individuals, communities of practice, and the organization as a whole. By managing knowledge effectively, organizations can leverage their greatest asset - the collective wisdom of their employees - to drive innovation and improve performance.

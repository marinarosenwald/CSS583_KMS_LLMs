Knowledge management is like organizing your toy box so you can find what you need when you want it. You have to put all your toys (knowledge) together in a special place where they are easy to see and use again later. This way, people can share their knowledge with others and make new things by combining different toys together. It's important to keep track of what we learn so we don't forget it and can use it again later!

Knowledge management is the systematic coordination of an organization's people, technology, processes, and structure to add value through sharing, creating, and applying knowledge. It involves identifying valuable intellectual assets and storing them in a way that makes future retrieval and reuse easy. Most executives recognize employee knowledge as their greatest asset but often struggle with managing it effectively.

Knowledge management is the process of coordinating an organization's resources (people, technology, processes, structure) to create, share, and apply knowledge to add value. It involves identifying valuable intellectual assets and storing them in a way that makes them easily accessible for future use. Many executives recognize the importance of knowledge management but struggle with implementing it effectively due to lack of understanding or resources. By identifying and managing knowledge assets, organizations can retain important information and prevent loss through retirement, turnover, or competition.

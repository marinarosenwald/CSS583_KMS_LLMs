Knowledge management is crucial for organizations as it helps them to manage their intellectual assets, which are their greatest assets according to executives. It involves coordinating people, technology, processes, and organizational structure to add value through sharing, creating, and applying knowledge. This leads to continuous learning and innovation within the organization. Without proper knowledge management, valuable knowledge is at risk of being lost when employees leave or retire, which can negatively impact the organization's performance. By identifying and preserving intellectual assets, organizations can ensure that their legacy materials are easily accessible and retrievable, allowing for efficient reuse and innovation.

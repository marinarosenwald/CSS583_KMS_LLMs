Knowledge Management (KM) is the process of organizing and sharing knowledge within an organization to increase efficiency and innovation. It involves creating, storing, and applying knowledge through various means such as lessons learned and best practices. The value of KM lies in its ability to help organizations retain valuable knowledge and avoid losing it due to employee turnover or retirement. By identifying intellectual assets and creating legacy materials, organizations can ensure that important knowledge is preserved and easily accessible for future use. This process also helps foster a culture of continuous learning within the organization.

Knowledge is like a treasure chest filled with precious jewels. It's important to capture, create, and share knowledge so that it can be used to make informed decisions and solve problems within an organization. In the KM cycle, there are several steps involved in capturing, creating, coding, sharing, accessing, applying, and reusing knowledge. Capturing involves gathering information from various sources, such as documents, meetings, and conversations. Creating involves organizing and analyzing this information to make it useful for the organization. Coding means organizing the information into a systematic way so that it can be easily accessed and shared. Sharing refers to sharing the knowledge with others within or outside of an organization, while accessing involves retrieving the knowledge when needed. Applying refers to using the knowledge in decision-making processes, and reusing implies utilizing the same knowledge again in future situations. 
Major KM processes include creating a higher-value-added knowledge product at each stage of knowledge processing and refining it through various means such as physical or logical cleaning up, restructuring, relabeling, indexing, integrating, standardizing, or updating the repository. These steps are important in managing knowledge within an organization to ensure that valuable information is not lost but rather shared and utilized effectively among team members.

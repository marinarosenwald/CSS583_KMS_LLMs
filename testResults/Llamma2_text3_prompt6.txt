This text book chapter describes the main steps in the Knowledge Management (KM) cycle. The cycle has five stages: capturing, creating, coding, sharing and applying knowledge. Capturing involves collecting information from various sources, while creating entails developing new ideas through innovation. Coding refers to organizing and categorizing the collected data, followed by sharing which involves disseminating the organized knowledge to relevant parties. Finally, applying is the process of utilizing the shared knowledge to solve problems or improve processes within an organization. The chapter also discusses major KM approaches such as that of Meyer and Zack (1996) who emphasize the importance of refining and updating knowledge in order to stay current and competitive.

In summary, this textbook chapter outlines the key steps involved in managing knowledge within an organization, from capturing and creating new ideas to sharing and applying them. It also highlights major approaches to KM and their emphasis on continual refinement and renewal of knowledge repositories to remain competitive.

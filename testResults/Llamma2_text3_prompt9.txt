This text is a summary of various concepts and processes related to Knowledge Management (KM). It describes the different stages involved in KM, including capturing, creating, coding, sharing, accessing, applying, and reusing knowledge within an organization. The chapter also provides a comprehensive overview of major KM frameworks and their components, as well as challenges and benefits associated with each stage.

The text begins by highlighting the lack of consensus on definitions for key terms in KM. It then presents various approaches to the KM cycle, including those proposed by Meyer and Zack (1996), Bukowitz and Williams (2000), McElroy (1999, 2003), Wiig (1993), Carlile and Rebentisch (2003), Evans, Dalkir, and Bidian (2015), and Xu et al. (2010). Each of these approaches provides a unique perspective on the KM cycle, with some focusing on creating value-added knowledge products at each stage of knowledge processing, while others emphasize the importance of refining and updating knowledge to avoid obsolescence.

The chapter also discusses major challenges associated with KM, such as capturing tacit knowledge, managing cultural differences, addressing resistance to change, and ensuring the security and privacy of knowledge assets. It concludes by highlighting the strategic and practical implications of managing knowledge throughout the KM cycle, including improving efficiency, enhancing innovation, and fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement.

In summary, this text provides an overview of various concepts and processes related to Knowledge Management (KM), as well as major challenges and benefits associated with each stage of the KM cycle. It highlights the importance of capturing, creating, coding, sharing, accessing, applying, and reusing knowledge within organizations to improve efficiency, enhance innovation, and foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement.

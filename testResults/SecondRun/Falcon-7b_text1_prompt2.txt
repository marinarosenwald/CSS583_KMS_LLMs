summarize this text like I am a 5th grader: The industrial age, when we made things, has made way for the knowledge age, when
organizational success depends on what it collectively knows, how efficiently it uses
what it knows, and how quickly it acquires and uses new knowledge (Davenport & Prusak,
1998). The most valuable benefits from KM arise from sharing knowledge with current
fellow employees and with future (often unknown) employees. Sharing knowledge
with current fellow employees ensures it moves around the organization so everyone
can benefit from best practices (adopt newer, better ways of doing things) and lessons
learned (avoid repeating things that failed).
KM, through knowledge use and reuse, has two major goals: improving organiza-
tional efficiency and increasing the organizational capacity to innovate. Efficiency
means getting more from less. Organizations use more information and knowledge,
and do so more quickly and more efficiently. KM helps organizations do this because
they can use their existing knowledge, knowledge they create, and external knowledge
to make better, faster decisions. KM also makes it easier to get the right knowl-
edge to the people who need it at the time they need it. It can help organizations
improve the quality of the knowledge they have by making it more useful and more
accessible. Finally, organizations can make sure they have the information they
need by using their own knowledge to create information that is more easily accessible.

Summarize this text in 100 words: The industrial age, when we made things, has made way for the knowledge age, when
organizational success depends on what it collectively knows, how efficiently it uses
what it knows, and how quickly it acquires and uses new knowledge (Davenport & Prusak,
1998). The most valuable benefits from KM arise from sharing knowledge with current
fellow employees and with future (often unknown) employees. Sharing knowledge
with current fellow employees ensures it moves around the organization so everyone
can benefit from best practices (adopt newer, better ways of doing things) and lessons
learned (avoid repeating things that failed).
KM, through knowledge use and reuse, has two major goals: improving organiza-
tional efficiency and increasing the organizational capacity to innovate. The first
goal involves finding, accessing, and using information and knowledge to make
better decisions, to be more productive, and to create value for the company.
KM is also about finding and accessing external information and knowledge from
people inside and outside our company. The second goal involves creating new
knowledge and sharing what we learn with others.
Organizations use knowledge for two purposes:
• To make better decisions.
• To increase the organizational capacity to innovate.
Organizations use knowledge for three purposes:
1. To make better decisions.
• The first purpose is making better decisions.
• The second purpose is to help the organization
make faster, more accurate and more reliable deci-
sions, and to improve the quality of decisions.
• The third purpose of knowledge is to increase
the organizational capacity to innovate, and
thus, to increase organizational competitiveness
and to gain competitive advantage.
